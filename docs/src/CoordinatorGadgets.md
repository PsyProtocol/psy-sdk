# Coordinator Gadgets

These gadgets are components used within circuits run by the Coordinator nodes.
### `BatchAppendUserRegistrationTreeGadget`

*   **File:** `append_user_registration_tree.rs` (Gadget definition)
*   **Purpose:** Aggregates multiple "Spiderman" append proofs sequentially for the User Registration Tree (`URT`). Handles padding for a fixed maximum number of sub-tree appends.
*   **Key Inputs/Witness:**
    *   `user_registration_tree_height`, `batch_sub_tree_height`, `max_sub_trees`: Parameters.
    *   `SpidermanUpdateProof[]`: Array witness containing the append proofs for each sub-tree batch being added.
*   **Key Outputs/Computed Values:**
    *   `old_root`: The root of the `URT` *before* all appends in this gadget instance.
    *   `new_root`: The root of the `URT` *after* all appends in this gadget instance.
*   **Core Logic/Constraints:**
    *   Instantiates `max_sub_trees` instances of `SpidermanAppendProofGadget`.
    *   Connects the `new_root` of one gadget to the `old_root` of the next in sequence.
    *   Handles witness padding by setting dummy proofs for unused slots.
*   **Assumptions:** Assumes witness `SpidermanUpdateProof` array is valid initially (constraints verify internal consistency). Assumes `old_root` of the first gadget matches the tree state before this operation.
*   **Role:** Allows efficient batching of user registration appends into a single ZK proof step for the Coordinator.

### `BatchDeployContractsGadget`

*   **File:** `deploy_contract.rs` (Gadget definition)

*   **Key Inputs/Witness:**
    *   `contract_tree_height`, `batch_sub_tree_height`: Parameters.
    *   `SpidermanUpdateProof`: Witness for the batch append operation on `GCON`.

*   **Key Outputs/Computed Values:**
    *   `old_root`, `new_root`: Start and end roots of the `GCON` tree for this batch append (from `spiderman_gadget`).
*   **Core Logic/Constraints:**
    *   Instantiates `SpidermanAppendProofGadget`.
    *   Instantiates `QEDContractLeafGadget` for each potential leaf slot in the batch.
    *   For each leaf slot marked as added (`is_added` from Spiderman proof):
        *   Computes the hash of the corresponding `QEDContractLeafGadget` witness.
        *   Asserts this computed hash matches the `new_leaves[i]` value from the Spiderman proof.
    *   Handles witness padding for unused leaf slots.
*   **Assumptions:** Assumes witness `SpidermanUpdateProof` and `QEDContractLeaf` array are valid initially. Assumes `old_root` of the Spiderman gadget matches the `GCON` state before this operation.
*   **Role:** Securely proves the batch addition of new contracts to the global contract tree, verifying consistency between the state update and the provided contract metadata.

### `VerifyAggUserRegistartionDeployContractsGUTAHeaderGadget`

*   **File:** `verify_agg_user_registration_deploy_guta.rs`
*   **Purpose:** Represents the combined state transitions resulting from aggregating User Registrations, Contract Deployments, and GUTA proofs. Acts as the core data structure within the Part 1 Aggregation circuit.

*   **Assumptions:** Assumes the input transition/header gadgets are correctly derived from verified proofs.
*   **Role:** Standardizes the output structure of the Part 1 aggregation step, providing a single hash commitment for verification by the final block circuit.

### `VerifyAggUserRegistartionDeployContractsGUTAGadget`

*   **File:** `verify_agg_user_registration_deploy_guta.rs`
*   **Purpose:** The core gadget within the Part 1 Aggregation circuit. Verifies the aggregated proofs for User Registrations, Contract Deployments, and GUTA, ensuring they are valid, used whitelisted circuits, and reference the same checkpoint state.
*   **Key Inputs/Witness:**
    *   Parameters and configuration for verifying each of the three input proofs (common data, whitelist/fingerprint configs, GUTA params).
    *   Proof objects and verifier data for each of the three input proofs.
    *   Witnesses for state transitions/headers corresponding to each proof.
    *   GUTA whitelist Merkle proof.
*   **Key Outputs/Computed Values:**
    *   `header`: A `VerifyAggUserRegistartionDeployContractsGUTAHeaderGadget` containing the verified state transitions.
*   **Core Logic/Constraints:**
    *   Instantiates `VerifyStateTransitionProofGadget` for User Registrations, verifying the proof against its config/fingerprint.
    *   Instantiates `VerifyStateTransitionProofGadget` for Contract Deployments similarly.
    *   Instantiates `VerifyGUTAProofGadget` for the GUTA proof, verifying it against its config/fingerprint and the GUTA whitelist root.
    *   Connects the `checkpoint_tree_root` from the GUTA header to ensure consistency (implicitly assumes UserReg/Deploy proofs are for the same checkpoint, which should be enforced by job planning). *Correction: This gadget doesn't directly connect checkpoint roots; that consistency is usually handled by the job system ensuring proofs for the same checkpoint are aggregated.*
    *   Constructs the output `header` from the verified transition gadgets.
*   **Assumptions:** Assumes witness proofs, headers, and verifier data are valid initially. Assumes input configuration (common data, fingerprint configs, whitelist root) is correct.
*   **Role:** Securely combines the results of the three major parallel state update processes (User Reg, Deploy Contract, GUTA) into a single verifiable unit, discharging assumptions about their individual validity and circuit usage.

### `QEDPart1StateDeltaResultGadget`

*   **File:** `checkpoint_state_transition_proofs.rs`

*   **Core Logic/Constraints:**
    *   Constructs `old_state_roots` and `new_state_roots` gadgets.
    *   Computes `new_stats` based on inputs (copying GUTA stats, hashing random seed, setting time, zeroing PM/DA stats for now).
    *   Constructs `old_checkpoint_leaf` and `new_checkpoint_leaf` gadgets.
    *   Asserts `block_time` > `old_stats.block_time`.
*   **Assumptions:** Assumes `part_1_header` is correctly verified. Assumes `old_stats`, `block_time`, `final_random_seed_contribution` witnesses are correct.

*   **Core Logic/Constraints:**
    *   Verifies the `part_1_proof_target` against `part_1_verifier_data`.
    *   Checks the fingerprint of `part_1_verifier_data` against `known_part_1_fingerprint`.

    *   Asserts `append_checkpoint_tree_proof.old_value` is zero hash (ensures append).
    *   Asserts `append_checkpoint_tree_proof.old_root` matches `previous_checkpoint_proof.root` (ensures continuity).
    *   Asserts `append_checkpoint_tree_proof.index` == `previous_checkpoint_proof.index + 1`.
